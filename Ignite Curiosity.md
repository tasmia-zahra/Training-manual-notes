# Ignite Curiosity
### The SMILE Method™
#### "As a SMILE Student™, You are responsible for your own exploration and your own curiosity."

- We promote education from early childhood to professional development thorugh the SMILE Method. This method involves a series of steps to inspire students, enlighten their own curiosity, identify their passions, work with others who share similar interests and goals, and give back the community by sharing their knowledge.
For over 25 years, we have trained individuals and provide ongoing encouragements, inspiration and mentorship to learners of all ages. We create learning environments that are peaceful, flexible and comprehensive with resources of self-motivated and self-directed exploration.
Nobody wants to sit in small desks and get lectured, but on the flipside -teachers do not want to work with students who lack motivation. 

- The Curiosity Coach emphasizes learning process, valuing making mistakes and practical application in real-world, leading to internships and job opportunitues.
